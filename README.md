Solder fume extractor

![Sorry, pretty picture of the finished product is broken.](https://github.com/mikeabuilder/solder-fume-extractor/blob/master/images/finished.jpg)



This repo contains design files and instructions for building this tilting solder fume extractor with built in high output LED work light. It's built around a standard 120V AC 120mm fan, and uses off-the-shelf filter.  The main body parts are laser cut from 3.2mm MDF, and there are a few parts that you'll need to 3D print. You'll also need to solder some 120V wiring (with the thing unplugged, of course!)

This kit was designed for members at my mocal maker space,  [BARN](https://bainbridgebarn.org/). The instructions refer to a parts kit, which is something we put togfether for our members. A description of the parts in the kit is at the end of the instruction document.  Ther is also a file called "purchased part BOM.xlsx" that has links to the sources for all the parts in the bag of parts, and also the fan I used.

**Laser cut parts** -   The design is for 3.2mm (1/8") material. All the slots and tabs are set up for this. There are files in LightBurn format that show how I fit all the parts into 2 sheets of 300mm x 500mm MDF

**3D printed parts** -  The 3D printed parts are designed to work with PLA, but other materials should work too. All the STL files are provided, and I';ve also inclued 3MF file in case you want to see how the parts were sliced when I printed the prototypes on my modified Anet A8.
