Solder fume extractor

![Sorry, pretty picture of the finished product is broken.](https://github.com/mikeabuilder/solder-fume-extractor/blob/master/images/finished.jpg)



This repo contains design files and instructions for building this tilting solder fume extractor with built in high output LED work light. It's built around a standard 120V AC 120mm fan, and uses off-the-shelf filter.  The main body parts are laser cut from 3.2mm MDF, and there are a few parts that you'll need to 3D print.

This kit was designed for members at my mocal maker space,  [BARN](https://bainbridgebarn.org/). The instructions refer to a parts kit, which is something we put togfether for our members. A description of the parts in the kit is at the end of the instruction document.  Ther is also a file called "purchased part BOM.xlsx" that has links to the sources for all the parts in the bag of parts, and also the fan I used.

Laser cut parts -   The design is for 3.2mm (1/8") material. All the slots and tabs are set up for this. There are files in LightBurn format that show how I fit all the parts into 2 sheets of 300mm x 500mm MDF
